# React exchange app

![screenshot](screenshot-socialnetwork.png)

Social network app developed with React. <br><br />
This social network is themed around the idea of exchange: its distinctive feature is that users can post messages in an "Exchange" section to exchange languages, skills, or services with other users.
<br /><br />
FEATURES: users can register/login, find people, make friends, chat, post messages, delete their account, and logout. In development, I added features where the user could upload a custom image profile and reset the password through
email using AWS. I've taken out both features in production to prevent the costs associated with AWS.<br> <br>
Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node with Express.js, PostgreSQL <br />
Libraries: React, Three.js, Socket.IO, bcrypt <br />
Storage: AWS <br />
Tested with Jest
<br />
<br />
FUTURE IMPROVEMENT: <br />
At the moment, posts in the Exchange section are only visible to the users' friends.
To improve user experience, I am planning on updating this section to let users choose if their post should be private or public.

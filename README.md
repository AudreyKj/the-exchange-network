Social network app developed with React. <br>
In this app, users can find people, make friends, chat, and post messages. It is themed around the idea of exchange: its distinctive feature is that users can post messages in an "Exchange" section to exchange languages, skills, or services with other users.
<br />
Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node with Express.js, PostgreSQL <br />
Libraries: React, Three.js, Socket.IO, bcrypt <br />
Storage: AWS <br />
<br />
<br />
FUTURE IMPROVEMENT: <br />
At the moment, posts in the Exchange section are only visible to the users' friends.
The user experience would be better if users could choose if their post was private or public.
